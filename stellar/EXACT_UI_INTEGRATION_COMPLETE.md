## 🔮 Future: Add Stellar Blockchain

When you're ready to add real Stellar functionality:

1. **Import Stellar hooks:**
```typescript
import { useWallet } from './stellar-wallet-kit'
```

2. **Replace mock data with Stellar contract calls:**
```typescript
const assets = await stellarContract.getAssets()
```

3. **Connect buttons to real transactions:**
```typescript
const fundTrade = async () => {
  await stellarContract.fundEscrow(tradeId)
}
```

But for now, you have **perfect UI replicas** with all the visual design from SmartProcure1!
