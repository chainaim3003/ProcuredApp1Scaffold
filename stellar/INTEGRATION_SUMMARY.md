## 🚀 How to Test

1. Start your development server:
```bash
cd C:\CHAINAIM3003\mcp-servers\ProcuredApp1Scaffold\stellar
npm run dev
```

2. Open browser and navigate:
   - Home: `http://localhost:5173/`
   - Exporter: `http://localhost:5173/exporter`
   - Importer: `http://localhost:5173/importer`

## 📝 What Was Removed

From the original SmartProcure1 components, we removed:

❌ **Algorand-specific imports:**
- `useWallet` from `@txnlab/use-wallet-react`
- `useApplicationState`, `useRoleSwitcher`
- All contract services (boxStorageService, escrowV5Service, etc.)
- Real API calls to Algorand blockchain

✅ **What was kept:**
- All visual design (JSX/HTML)
- Layout and styling
- Tab navigation logic
- Sample data for demonstration
- Button components and interactions (UI only)

---

## 💡 Next Steps (Optional)

If you want to add Stellar blockchain functionality later, you can:

1. Import Stellar wallet hooks
2. Add Stellar contract calls
3. Replace sample data with real blockchain data
4. Connect buttons to actual Stellar transactions

But for now, you have **working UI pages** with all the visual content from SmartProcure1!

---

## ✅ Summary

**Before:** SmartProcure1 had 3 tabs with Algorand blockchain

**After:** ProcuredApp1Scaffold has 3 clean UI pages without any blockchain

**Result:** 
- ✅ All visual content preserved
- ✅ Stellar Home page untouched
- ✅ No Algorand dependencies
- ✅ Ready to use with Stellar (if needed later)
- ✅ Clean, simple, and functional UI

---

**🎉 Integration Complete! Your app now has 3 new pages with clean UI!**
